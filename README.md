# energy-demand-forecast-ml
machine learning models LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and XGBoost  to forecast energy consumption based on historical data. It aims to enhance energy demand prediction accuracy by leveraging both sequential patterns and feature-based learning.
Project Goals
- Predict future energy consumption based on historical data
- Compare performance between LSTM and XGBoost models
- Visualize predictions against actual values
- Provide a reproducible and scalable ML workflow
